# ZoomBackgrounds

This is for Zoom meeting backgrounds (or any other system that supports (.mp4's and image files as backgrounds -- teams, webex, etc.)

MP4's as of this writing are only supported on Zoom to my knowledge.

##Scraping from Youtube

To scrape a video from youtube for use:

1. Get the Youtube URL (ex: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGqz3qklCck)
1. Go to one of the many "Youtube to MP#" sites out there like: https://www.flvto.biz/en66/youtube-to-mp4/ (careful not to click on shady ads)
1. Run it through and download the *.mp4
1. Set it up as your background in Zoom or whatever
